# modsecurity-sbrs

The ModSecurity Score-Based Rule Set (SBRS) is a set of application-level attack detection rules for use with ModSecurity.

The goal is to block malicious web requests (SQL-Injection, Remote Command Execution and Local File Inclusion attempts, etc.) by implementing a scoring mechanism and avoiding the most common problems associated with the integration of ModSecurity into production servers, such as false positive errors, heavy customization based on application logic or high CPU and memory usage.
